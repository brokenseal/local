A working chat client/server implementation based on:

### Client
 - Yeoman (bower, grunt, yo)
 - AngularJS
 - SockJS

 ### Server
  - sockjs-tornado
  - Django
  - Redis

Steps to perfect awesomeness:
 - create a new virtual environment
 - install requirements for the django project
 - install yeoman
 - start the sockjs-tornado server by running "./manage.py io"
 - start redis
 - run "grunt server" from the web-client directory
 - grab a beer
